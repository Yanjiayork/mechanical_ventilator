# Part of the data extracted from MIMIC III is adapted from Dr Niranjani Prasad at https://github.com/bee-hive/VentRL/tree/master/utils. After building the time Frame of the included patients on an hour basis, blood pressure and and SBT are also added in add_bloodpre.ipynb and add_sbt.ipynb. Then the date is processed in data_process.ipynb to generate the training, validation and test dataset for this work. Extubation_failure cohort is generated in extubaition_failure_data_process.ipynb.
PCA_visu gives a PCA visuliation of the data.
