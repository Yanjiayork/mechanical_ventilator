Part of the data extracted from MIMIC III is adapted from Dr Niranjani Prasad at https://github.com/bee-hive/VentRL/tree/master/utils. After building the time Frame of the included patients on an hour basis, blood pressure and SBT are then added in add_bloodpre.ipynb and add_sbt.ipynb. Then the data is processed in data_process.ipynb to generate the training, validation and test dataset for this work. Extubation_failure cohort is generated in extubaition_failure_data_process.ipynb.
PCA_visu gives a PCA visuliation of the data. The CNN model is trained in CNN_model.ipynb. The final CNN model is saved in the folder final_model. 
The feature importance along with the counterfactual examples are produced in feature_explanation.ipynb using the final model trained in the previous step.
